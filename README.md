Version Control System (GIT)
What is Version Control System (VCS) ?
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file (or) set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

In Version control system (VCS) the team of developers collaborates together and they can work on same code (or) project.

“Git” is a software tool that enables version control of the source code. Git helps to: Track different versions of the same file.

Why is version control used?
Version control serves as a safety net to protect the source code from irreparable harm, giving the development team the freedom to experiment without fear of causing damage or creating code conflicts.

There are three types of VCS :

The types of VCS are:

Local Version Control System.
Centralized Version Control System.
Distributed Version Control System.
Local Version Control System
A local version control system is a local database located on your local computer, in which every file change is stored as a patch. Every patch set contains only the changes made to the file since its last version.

Centralized Version Control System
In a centralized version control system (CVCS) — also known as a centralized source control or revision control system — a server acts as the main centralized repository which stores every version of code.

Distributed Version Control System
A distributed version control system (DVCS) brings a local copy of the complete repository to every team member's computer, so they can commit, branch, and merge locally.

The server doesn't have to store a physical file for each branch — it just needs the differences between each commit.
